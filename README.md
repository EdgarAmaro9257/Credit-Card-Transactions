# Exploratory Data Analysis for Credit Card Transaction Fraud Detection

This project focuses on identifying suspicious patterns in credit card transactions using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. Various Python libraries, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn, were used to clean, manipulate, and visualize the data. The main objective is to detect potential fraud by analyzing the correlation between variables, identifying outliers, and studying the geographical and temporal distribution of transactions.

The goal of this project is to provide a solid foundation for creating predictive models that help financial institutions detect and prevent fraud more effectively.
